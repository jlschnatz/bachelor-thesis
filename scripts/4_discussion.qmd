# General Discussion

- The aim of the present study was to introduce a flexible simulation-based framework to assess publication bias...
- 2 sentences about SPEEC
- Short reiteration of confiromatory results (only that weird results were obtained)
- Confirmatory results


## What Factors Drives the Parameter Estimation Challenges?


## Discussion of the Exploratory Diagnostic Results

- Across all distributional parameters (except $\mu_d$) *systematic* divergences between SPEEC and MLE with nonlinear functional forms, as values of parameters from MLE increased, divergences from SPEEC not constant
- Correlation analyses indicated a consistency in misestimation of SPEEC from MLE for the mean and variance parameter of the Gaussian effect size distribution (strong positive correlation)
- No evidence that misestimation in effect size distribution was associated with misestimation of sample size distribution
- Misestimation in the parameters of the effect size distribution were negatively associated with the predicted publication bias -> this indicates that there was also a consitency between the misestimation in publication bias and misestimation of effect size parameters

What´s causing between divergences between MLE and SPEEC and the nonsensical predictions for SPEEC?

- No evidence that uncertainty related to the size of the RRR was associated with the misestimation (results are inconclusive) -> connect to simulation study in which we can systematically which influence sample size has
- However, strong evidence that misestimation between ML and SPEEC was positively associated with between-study heterogeneity -> increased heterogeneity was associated with increased misestimation + increases in heterogeneity was associated with increases in misestimation in publication bias parameter (-> negative correlation, discuss adjusted and unadjusted p-value)
- Current simulation framework of SPEEC assumes fixed-effects meta-analytical model -> only variance source is sampling error 


- **Q1**: To what degree do the Estimated sitributional parameters differ between SPEC and MLE? There are *systematic* differences between MLE and SPEEC for $\sigma^2_d$, $\mu_n$, and $\phi_n$, where differences between the both is not constant across the range of the estimated parameters from MLE
- **Q2**: How are the discrepancies in one parameter associated with those in the other distributional parameters across SPEEC and MLE? Specifically, does a consistency exist in the discrepancies between these parameters?
  - Correlational analyses: strong positive correlation between divergences between ML and SPEEC for the parameters of the effect size distribution -> misestimation in one was associated with the other
  - There was no evidence that the misestimation in effect size distribution were related to misestimation in sample size distribution
- **Q3**: Is the discrepancy between SPEEC and MLE in the distributional parameters associated with the publication bias parameter $\pbs$?
  - divergences between ML and SPEEC of both parameters of the effect size distribution were negatively associated with publication bias parameter
  - as misestimation increased stronger predicted publication bias (for which we know can´t be the case)? 
  -  misestimation in effect size parameters were associated with misestimation in $\pbs$
- Does the discrepancy between SPEEC and MLE estimates of the distribtion parameters correltate with the sample size of the RRRs ($k$)? No evidence for that
- Is the discrepancy between SPEEC and MLE in the distributional paraemters and the publication bias parameters associatd with effect size heterogeneity? YES! 
- strong positive relationship with effect size parameters -> as heterogeneity increased -> divergence between ML and SPEEC for effect size parameters increased 
  - negative correlation with publication bias parameter: more severe  publication bias associated with increased heterogenetiy
  - Is this the explanation of the problems? -> discuss


## Limitations 

- Limitations of SPEEC
  -  No hypothesis test -> or quantification of uncertainty of estimation right now
- Limitations of the study
  - Study designed as a proof of concept -> only a preliminary evalution of the SPEEC method
  - Need large simulation study


## Future Work

- clear need to implement heterogeneity aspects to get it to work, sample size planning
-
