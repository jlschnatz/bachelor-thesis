# General Discussion

The objective of the present thesis was to introduce a flexible simulation-based framework, to assess the extent of publication bias and estimate corrected effect sizes based on the joint distribution of effect size and sample size in the presence of publication bias (SPEEC). In a proof-of-concept study, the viability of the SPEEC method was evaluated through four theoretically justified hypotheses, which were should be corroborated by empirical data encompassing both classical meta-analyses and publication bias-free registered replication reports (RRRs) if the method works in principle. The confirmatory analyses revealed that, while three out of the four predictions were statistically significant, the effect sizes for these hypotheses were weak. Additionally, no evidence supported the fourth hypothesis pointing to potential issues with the parameter estimation in the SPEEC method.

To further diagnose these potential parameter estimation challenges, five exploratory diagnostic questions were derived, using the subset of publication bias-free RRRs to compare the distributional parameters estimated using SPEEC to those estimated using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Additionally, it was examined how these divergences between SPEEC and MLE are associated with the publication bias parameter $\pbs$ and uncertainty-related factors such as the meta-analytical sample size $k$ and between-study heterogeneity $\tau$. Overall, this analysis aimed to quantify the extent and consistency of misestimations in SPEEC compared to MLE (questions 1-3) and to identify potential root causes of the parameter estimation issues (questions 4-5).

## Extent and Consistency of Misestimation of SPEEC Parameters

Regarding the first three exploratory diagnostic questions, it was found that, except for the mean $\mu_d$ of the effect size distribution, there were *systematic* divergences between SPEEC and MLE in the parameter estimation. This misestimation of SPEEC from MLE was not constant across the parameter space of the MLE estimates, displaying nonlinear functional forms and substantial heteroscedasticity. 

The correlational analyses indicated a consistency in the misestimation of SPEEC compared to MLE for the mean $|\Delta_{\widehat{\mu}_d}|$ and variance parameter $|\Delta_{\widehat{\sigma}^2_d}|$ of the effect size distribution. In other words, an increase in the absolute divergence between SPEEC and MLE in one parameter was associated with an increase in the absolute divergence in the other parameter. The absence of any substantial (and significant) correlations between the divergences of SPEEC and MLE for effect size distribution parameters ($|\Delta_{\widehat{\mu}_d}|$, $|\Delta_{\widehat{\sigma}^2_d}|$) and sample size distribution parameters ($|\Delta_{\widehat{\phi}_n}|$, $|\Delta_{\widehat{\mu}_n}|$) suggests there is no evidence of a consistency between the misestimation of of SPEEC from MLE of effect size parameters and sample size parameters. However, there was a strong and statistically significant negative correlation between the parameters of the effect size distribution ($|\Delta_{\widehat{\mu}_d}|$, $|\Delta_{\widehat{\sigma}^2_d}|$) and the publication bias parameter $\epbs$ such that larger divergences between MLE and SPEEC of the distributional parameters were associated with lower predicted values of the publication bias parameter. Because, as argued previously, $\epbs$ should equal theoretically exactly 1, this negative correlation can be interpreted as a consistency in the misestimation of the effect size parameter of SPEEC from MLE and the misestimation of the publication bias parameter $\epbs$.

## What Factors Drive the Parameter Misestimation in SPEEC?

The systematic discrepancy between MLE and SPEEC for the distribution parameters, together with the consistency in the misestimation of the effect size parameters and the publication bias parameter, begs the question of what factors are responsible for the parameter misestimation of the SPEEC method.

In this regard, no evidence was found that uncertainty related to the sample size $k$ of the RRRs was associated with the misestimation of the distributional parameters of SPEEC from MLE. However, strong positive correlations were observed between the misestimation of SPEEC from MLE in the effect size distribution parameters ($|\Delta_{\widehat{\mu}d}|$, $|\Delta{\widehat{\sigma}^2_d}|$) and between-study heterogeneity $\widehat{\tau}$. Additionally, a medium negative correlation was observed between the publication bias parameter $\epbs$ and between-study heterogeneity $\widehat{\tau}$.


As I will argue below, this may be a plausible cause of the parameter misestimation of the SPEEC method regarding the empirical data.


Current simulation-framework of the SPEEC method assumes fixed-effects meta-analytical model, where only source of effect size variation is attributable to sampling error.

Meta-analyses and RRRs used for the proof of concept displayed moderate to large levels of between-study heterogeneity [@linden_heterogeneity_2021]. 

This means that empirical data displayed additional level of effect size variation, that could not be modeled in SPEEC method due to sampling error alone.

Because of how the loss function for the stochastic optimization is defined -> minimizing the kullback-leibler divergence between estimated kernel densities from empirical and simulated data of effect size sample size distribution -> this means in practice that within the optimization parameters evolve such that the similarity between both is maximized

Dadurch dass SPEEC method nicht heterogeneität modelliert, ist eine plausible erklärung, dass die effectstärke parameter verschätzt werden "müssen" damit KLD minimiert wird.


When empirical effect size sample size distribution displays more effect size heterogeneity than can be modeled in the simulated data due to sampling error alone, SPEEC method has adjust the parameters of the simulated data, such that it minimizes the KLD 

- overestimation of variance parameter of SPEEC method $\sigma^2_d$ 
- decrease in publication bias parameter $\pbs$, the lower $\pbs$ (the higher the predicted extent of publication bias), the larger the variance in the effect size distribution due to the emerging sparsity of data loss for nonsignificant simulated studies (with effect sizes close to zero and small sample sizes)



- explain how these results align with other approaches‘ problems to account for heterogeneity
 

## Limitations


- Limitations of SPEEC
  -  No hypothesis test -> or quantification of uncertainty of estimation right now
- Limitations of the study
  - Study designed as a proof of concept -> only a preliminary evalution of the SPEEC method
  - Need large simulation study


## Directions for Future Research

1. Further development of the SPEEC method
   - Given that between-study heterogeneity is very common in psychology and other fields [@linden_heterogeneity_2021; @van_erp_estimates_2017; @kenny_unappreciated_2019] -> importance of incorporting heterogeneity parameter in the simulation framework -> einordnung der ergebnise -> sonst parameter schätzung nicht gut
   - Consider sample size planning, p-hacking etc.
2. Comprehensive Evaluation of the SPEEC method (simulation study)
   - Comprehensive simulation study
   - How does adapted SPEEC perform under various conditions -> heterogeneity, sample size, true effect size, degree of publication bias, (additional) p-hacking
