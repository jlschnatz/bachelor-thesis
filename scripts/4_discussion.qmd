# General Discussion

- The aim of the present study was to introduce a flexible simulation-based framework to assess publication bias...
- 2 sentences about SPEEC
- Short reiteration of confiromatory results (only that weird results were obtained)
- Confirmatory results


## Extent and Consistency of Misestimation of SPEEC Parameters


- Regarding the first three exploratory questions we found that across all distributional parameters, except the mean $\mu_d$ of the effect size distribution, *systematic* divergences between SPEEC and MLE. 
- Across the estimated parameter space from MLE, these divergences were not constant and with nonlinear functional forms displaying substantial heteroscedasticity
- Correlational analyses indicated that there was a consistency in the misestimation of SPEEC from MLE for the mean and variance parameter of the effect size distribution -> increase in absolute divergence in the one was associated with increase in absolute divergence in the other
- No evidence that misestimation in effect size distribution was associated with misestimation of sample size distribution
- Also: consistency in misestimation in the parameters of the effect size distribution ($\mu_d$, $\sigma^2_d$) and publication bias parameter $\pbs$ -> larger divergences were associated with lower predicted values for $\pbs$ for which we know in the RRR subset that this should not be the case (because PBS absent)

## What Factors Drive the Parameter Misestimation in SPEEC?

What´s causing between divergences between MLE and SPEEC and the nonsensical predictions for SPEEC?

- No evidence that uncertainty related to the size of the RRR was associated with the misestimation (results are inconclusive) -> connect to simulation study in which we can systematically which influence sample size has
- However, strong evidence that misestimation between ML and SPEEC was positively associated with between-study heterogeneity -> increased heterogeneity was associated with increased misestimation + increases in heterogeneity was associated with increases in misestimation in publication bias parameter (-> negative correlation, discuss adjusted and unadjusted p-value)
- Current simulation framework of SPEEC assumes fixed-effects meta-analytical model -> only variance source is sampling error
-  explain idea of "compensation" when there is more heterogeneity than can be modeled due to sampling error
- explain in the context of the loss function -> minimizing the KLD between estimated kernel densities from empirical and ismulated data
- this "must" result in overestimation of variance parameter of SPEEC method $\sigma^2_d$
- also decrease in publication bias parameter $\pbs$ could be explained by heterogeneity: the lower the publication bias parameter (the higher the predicted extent of publication bias), the larger the variance in the effect size estimate due to the emerging sparsity for effects that are nonsignificant (low sample size, low effect size)
- explain how these results align with other approaches‘ problems to account for heterogeneity
 

## Limitations 

- Limitations of SPEEC
  -  No hypothesis test -> or quantification of uncertainty of estimation right now
- Limitations of the study
  - Study designed as a proof of concept -> only a preliminary evalution of the SPEEC method
  - Need large simulation study


## Future Work

- clear need to implement heterogeneity aspects to get it to work, sample size planning


## Conclusion
