# General Discussion

- The aim of the present study was to introduce a flexible simulation-based framework to assess publication bias...
- 2 sentences about SPEEC
- Short reiteration of confiromatory results (only that weird results were obtained)
- Confirmatory results


## What Factors Drives the Parameter Estimation Challenges?


## Discussion of the Exploratory Diagnostic Results

- **Q1**: To what degree do the estimated sitributional parameters differ between SPEC and MLE? There are *systematic* differences between MLE and SPEEC for $\sigma^2_d$, $\mu_n$, and $\phi_n$, where differences between the both is not constant across the range of the estimated parameters from MLE
- **Q2**: How are the discrepancies in one parameter associated with those in the other distributional parameters across SPEEC and MLE? Specifically, does a consistency exist in the discrepancies between these parameters?
  - Correlational analyses: strong positive correlation between divergences between ML and SPEEC for the parameters of the effect size distribution -> misestimation in one was associated with the other
  - There was no evidence that the misestimation in effect size distribution were related to misestimation in sample size distribution
- **Q3**: Is the discrepancy between SPEEC and MLE in the distributional parameters associated with the publication bias parameter $\pbs$?
  - divergences between ML and SPEEC of both parameters of the effect size distribution were negatively associated with publication bias parameter
  - as misestimation increased stronger predicted publication bias (for which we know canÂ´t be the case)? 
  -  misestimation in effect size parameters were associated with misestimation in $\pbs$
- Does the discrepancy between SPEEC and MLE estimates of the distribtion parameters correltate with the sample size of the RRRs ($k$)? No evidence for that
- Is the discrepancy between SPEEC and MLE in the distributional paraemters and the publication bias parameters associatd with effect size heterogeneity? YES! 
- strong positive relationship with effect size parameters -> as heterogeneity increased -> divergence between ML and SPEEC for effect size parameters increased 
  - negative correlation with publication bias parameter: more severe  publication bias associated with increased heterogenetiy
  - Is this the explanation of the problems? -> discuss


## Limitations 

- Limitations of SPEEC
  -  No hypothesis test -> or quantification of uncertainty of estimation right now
- Limitations of the study
  - Study designed as a proof of concept -> only a preliminary evalution of the SPEEC method
  - Need large simulation study


## Future Work

- clear need to implement heterogeneity aspects to get it to work, sample size planning
- 


## Conclusion
