## The SPEEC Method

<!-- Finished this section! -->

This section offers a comprehensive description and explanation of the SPEEC framework to assess the extent of publication bias and estimate effect sizes in the presence of publication bias in meta-analyses. The flowchart in @fig-speec-workflow provides an overview of the sequentials steps of the SPEEC method. Currently, SPEEC is being developed as an open-source R package and is accessible on GitHub at <https://github.com/jlschnatz/speec> (alpha version).

### Simulation Framework

<!-- Finished! -->

The initial step in the SPEEC method entails defining the marginal distributions of effect size and sample size for the generative publication bias model. This requires additional assumptions regarding the type of study design from which the simulated effect sizes and sample sizes originate. For the purpose of this study, Cohen´s *d* is adopted as a widely used effect sizes measure for mean differences[@lakens_calculating_2013] as the effect size of interest. Consequently, it is assumed that the simulated effect sizes originate from a between-subjects two-sample *t*-test study design. However, it is worth noting that the SPEEC framework is adaptable to different study designs where alternative effect size measures are typically employed (e.g., correlational effect sizes or effect sizes derived from proportional data). Depending on the effect size, this would require adapting the marginal distribution of the effect size and  how statistical significance is determined based on a different test statistic, which is required for the application of publication bias (see [Application of Publication Bias](Application of Publication Bias)).

The marginal distribution for the total sample size $\mathrm{n}$ of a study should be inherently modeled as a discrete distribution. Count data of this nature are commonly modeled using either a Poisson or Negative-Binomial distribution. In various psychological domains, sample size distributions often exhibit considerable variance and skewness [see for example @cafri_meta-meta-analysis_2010; @marszalek_sample_2011; @sassenberg_research_2019; @shen_samples_2011; @szucs_empirical_2017]. Considering this, the Negative-Binomial distribution was chosen as it can model overdispersed better effectively by introducing a second parameter [@lloyd-smith_maximum_2007; @ismail_handling_2007]. The mean-dispersion parametrization of the Negative-Binomial distribution is used where probability of sucess $p$ and the target number of sucesses $r$ are reparametrized to mean $\mu = \frac{r\cdot(1-p)}{p}$ and dispersion $\phi=r$ to model the study-specific total sample sizes $n_i$.

$$
n_1, \,n_2,\, \ldots, \,n_k \quad \text{where} \quad N\stackrel{\mathrm{i.i.d.}}{\sim} \mathcal{NB}(\phi_n, \mu_n) \quad \text{for } i = 1, \ldots, k
$$ {#eq-nb-dist}

Concerning the marginal distribution of effect size $\mathrm{d}$, it is reasonable to assume a Gaussian distribution with mean $\mu_d$ and variance $\sigma^2_d$. To account for the increasing precision in estimating the true effect size mean $\mu_d$ as the sample size increases (i.e., the sampling error), we compute the variance of the mean differences $\bar{x}_{i1} - \bar{x}_{i2}$, from which the effect sizes are assumed to originate in this type of study design. Subsequently,  a normalization factor $\gamma_i$ can be derived by scaling each individual variance $\sigma^2_{\bar{x}_{i1} - \bar{x}_{i2}}$ with the overall mean of those variances such that that $\bar{\gamma}=1$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
\sigma^2_{\bar{x}_{i1} - \bar{x}_{i2}}=\sigma_d^2/n_i \\
\gamma_i=\frac{\sigma^2_{\bar{x}_{i1} - \bar{x}_{i2}}}{\sum_{i=1}^{k}\sigma^2_{\bar{x}_{i1} - \bar{x}_{i2}}/k} \\
\end{gathered}
$$ {#eq-normalization}

\noindent
With this normalization factor, the total variance of the individual variances of the individual variances is $\mathbb{E}(\gamma_i \cdot \sigma^2_d) = \sigma^2_d$. The study-specific effect sizes $d_i$ are subsequently modeled as

$$
d_1, \,d_2, \,\ldots, \,d_k \quad \text{where} \quad D \stackrel{}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(\mu_d, \gamma_i\cdot\sigma_d^2) \quad \text{for} \quad i = 1, \ldots, k.
$$ {#eq-norm-dist}

Using this definition for the marginal distribution of effect size, the SPEEC method assumes a fixed effects meta-analytical model, where the only source of variation in effect size is explained by measurement error. However, it is worth noting that the publication bias simulation model of the SPEEC method could be further extended to account for effect size heterogeneity. This could involve including an additional heterogeneity parameter $\tau^2$ in the simulation framework to account for additional variability bayond sampling error.

Conditional on the marginal distributions, $k$ individual studies are sampled from the joint distribution of effect size and sample size. The selection of $k$ is user-defined, however, the larger the number of samples $k$, the lower the uncertainty of the joint distribution of effect size and sample size. In general, there is a trade-off between the increased computational cost and the reduced uncertainty of the joint distribution for increasing values of $k$. We opted for $k=10^4$ samples for each simulation iteration for the analyses of the hypotheses.

### Application of Publication Bias

<<!- Nochmal drüber schauen nach Einleitung -->

Following the simulation step of sampling $k$ studies from the joint distribution of effect size and sample size, the subsequent stage involves the application of publication bias to the samples studies. As previously discussed, publication bias is operationalized in terms of the likelihood of a study being published conditional on the statistical significance of its results. Statistical significance in traditional null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) contexts is commonly determined using *p*-values, employing a dichotomous decision rule with conventional type I erro-rates set as cut-off values [@andrade_p_2019; @mcshane_abandon_2019]. Translated to this simulation setting, two-tailed *p*-values for each individual study *i* can be calculated from the corresponding effect size $d_i$ and sample size $n_i$. To implement this, it is assumed that the individual studies $i$ originate from a balanced sample size design. That is, when the total sample size $n_i$ is even, the between-subject group sample sizes $n_{1i}$ and $n_{2i}$ are defined as $n_i/2$. Otherwise, when the total sample size $n_i$ is odd, the group sample sizes are determined as the ceilinged $\lceil n_i/2 \rceil$ and floored $\lfloor n_i/2 \rfloor$ values, respectively. Subsequently, the *p*-value $p_i$ of each simulated study can be derived from its corresponding *t*-value 

$$
t_i=\Big\lvert \frac{d_i}{\sqrt{1/n_{1i} +1/n_{2i}}} \Big\rvert.
$$ {#eq-t-value}

$$
p_i=2 \cdot P(t_i~|~df_i)
$$ {#eq-p-value}

\noindent
where $P(t_i , \, df_i)$ is the cumulative *t*-distribution with degrees of freedom $df_i=n_i-2$. Given each *p*-value $p_i$, publication bias is introduced by assigning each study $i$ a weight

$$
\omega_{\text{PBS}_i}(p_i)= \begin{cases}  
\pbs & \text{for}~~p_i \geq \alpha \\
1 & \text{otherwise}\end{cases}
$$ {#eq-pbs}

\noindent
with the constraint $\pbs \in \mathbb{R} : 0 \leq \pbs \leq 1$. This weight denotes the probability of a study $i$ being selected conditional on the *p*-value and the type I error rate $\alpha$. This definition of the publication bias weight is directly analogue to the step weighting function used in publication bias selection models [see @hedges_modeling_1992; @iyengar_selection_1988]. If a study $i$ is  statistically nonsignificant (i.e., $p_i \geq \alpha$), the publication bias parameter $\pbs$ is assigned, else the probability of a study being selected is equal to one, indicating no publication bias. Thus, the publication bias parameter $\pbs$ denotes the probability of the selection of a non-significant study relative to a statistiacally significant study. For instance, a publication bias parameter of $\pbs=0.5$ would indicate that simulated studies that are non-significant are half as likely to be selected (i.e., published) in comparison to studies that are statistically significant. Importantly, the type I error rate needs to be fixed across all simulated studies and is set to the common significance threshold of $\alpha = 0.05$ for the analyses of the hypotheses. Following the computation of publication bias weight $\omega_{\text{PBS}_i}$ for each study $i$, the probability of a study being selected can be expressed as $\mathbb{P}(S_i = 1)= \omega_{\text{PBS}_i}$. Here, $S_i$ is a binary indicator function, signifying whether an individual study $i$ is selected during the publication bias selection process. Following the computation of the of the publication bias weight $\omega_{\text{PBS}_i}$ for each study $i$, the publication bias selection process can be defined in terms of an indicator function.

$$
1_\alpha(\omega_{\text{PBS}_i}) = 
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if} \quad \omega_{\text{PBS}_i}\geq\alpha \quad \text{study not selected} \\
1 & \text{if} \quad \omega_{\text{PBS}_i} < \alpha  \quad \text{study selected}
\end{cases}
$$ {#eq-indicator-function}

\noindent
Using this indictor function, the resulting subsets for the selected $(d_i^\prime, \,n_i^\prime)$ and non-selected samples $(d_i^{\prime\prime}, \,n_i^{\prime\prime})$ from the initial $k$ simulated studies can be defined as

$$
\begin{gathered}
\big\{d_i^\prime, n_i^\prime\big\} = \big\{d_i, n_i ~ | ~ 1_\alpha(\omega_{\text{PBS}_i})= 1\big\} \quad \text{for} \quad i = 1, \dots, k^\prime \quad \text{and} \\
\big\{d_i^{\prime\prime}, n_i^{\prime\prime}\big\} = \big\{d_i, n_i ~ | ~ 1_\alpha(\omega_{\text{PBS}_i})= 0\big\} \quad \text{for} \quad i = 1, \dots, k^{\prime\prime}.
\end{gathered}
$$ {#eq-subsets}


One challenge in simulating a fixed number of $k$ studies lies in the fact that, ceteris paribus, as the degree of publication bias increases (i.e. for lower values for $\pbs$), increasingly fewer studies $k^\prime$ remain after the selection process compared to the original number of simulations $k$. This would lead to a loss of precision in the parameter estimation for decreasing values of $\pbs$. To adress this, the aforementioned steps (from @eq-nb-dist - @eq-subsets) are repeated a second time with an adjusted number of simulations $k_{\small{\text{adj}}} = \big\lceil {k^2}/{k'} \big\rceil$, thereby ensuring that the number of selected studies $k^\prime_{\small{\text{adj}}}$ is approximately equal over the entire range of $\pbs$.

### Formulation as an Optimization Problem

After the simulation of $k_{\small{\text{adj}}}$ from the publication bias model conditional of the marginal distributional parameters ($\mu_d$, $\sigma^2_d$, $\phi_n$, $\mu_n$) and the publication bias parameter $\pbs$ to determine the subset $(d_i^\prime, \,n_i^\prime)$ for $i=1, \dots,i=k_{\small{\text{adj}}}^\prime$, the following step involves quantifying how closely the simulated data from the publication bias model aligns with the empirical meta-analytical data. More specifically, this step involves measuring the statistical dissimilarity of the  bivariate kernel density estimates between the empirical meta-analytical data and the simulated data of the publication bias model. While various measures of statistical dissimilarity between probability distributions exist (for an overview, see @cha_comprehensive_2007), the Kullback-Leibler divergence [KL-divergence, @kullback_information_1951] was chosen as a dissimlarity measure for SPEEC. This choice was motivated by the KL-divergence's superior performance in capturing dissimilarity between estimated kernel densities compared to alternative measures (total variation distance and earthmover distance) tested for the SPEEC method, particularly across boundary conditions. In addition, the KL divergence has an intuitive interpretation in this context. It can be interpreted as the expected value of the log-likelihood ratio favoring the ture model over a candidate model [@etz_technical_2018]. Here, the estimated joint density of effect size and sample size from the meta-analytical data $\widehat{f}_{e}$ is regarded as the true data generating distribution, and the estimated kernel density from the simulated data $\widehat{f}_{t}$ generated by the publication bias model serves as the approximate candidate distribution.

To implement this step, the *KernSmooth* R package [@wand_kernsmooth_2023] was used to estimate the joint kernel density distribution for both empirical data and simulated using a bivariate standard Gaussian kernel that is evaluated on a linearly-binned square grid [@wand_fast_1994; @wand_kernel_1994]. The grid size was chosen to be $n_{\text{grid}}=2^7+1$ equidistant grid points in each dimension but is user-definable in the *speec* R package. The bandwidth of the kernel function was determined using the reliable plug-in method proposed by @sheather_reliable_1991, but the *speec* R package also offers other common bandwidth selection methods. To ensure the comparability of the estimated kernel densities between the empirical and simulated data, the bounds of the the square grid, $\mathrm{b}_\mathrm{n} \times \mathrm{b}_\mathrm{d}$, must be identical and are determined from the empirical meta-analytical data. 

For defining these bounds, the maximum likelihood values for the parameters of the marginal distribution of effect size ($\hat{\mu}_d,\hat{\sigma}^2_d$) and sample size ($\hat{\phi}_n, \hat{\mu}_n$) are estimated. Using these estimates, the quantiles spanning the inner 99 percentile of the cumulative distribution are obtained from the quantile functions $Q_d(p ~ | ~ \hat{\mu}_d, ~ \hat{\sigma}^2_d)$ and $Q_d(p ~ | ~ \hat{\phi}_n, ~ \hat{\mu}_n)$, for the percentiles $p_1=0.5$ and $p_2 = 99.5$. Subsequently the bounds for the effect size $\mathrm{b}_\mathrm{d}$ and sample size $\mathrm{b}_\mathrm{n}$ are defined as the minimum and maximum values of these quantiles and the range of the empirical data, respectively.

$$
\begin{gathered}
 \mathrm{b}_\mathrm{d}=\left\{Q_d(p_1 ~ | ~ \hat{\mu}_d, \, \hat{\sigma}_d^2) \land \min(d), \, Q_d(p_2 ~ | ~ \hat{\mu}_d, \, \hat{\sigma}_d^2) \lor \max(d) \right\} \\
\mathrm{b}_\mathrm{n} = \left\{Q_n(p_1 ~ | ~ \hat{\phi}_n, \, \hat{\mu}_n) \land \min(n), \, Q_n(p_2 ~ | ~ \hat{\phi}_n, \, \hat{\mu}_n) \lor \max(n) \right\}
\end{gathered}
$$ {#eq-bounds-kde}

This ensures that the an adequate range is covered for the kernel density estimation. Finally, the Kullback-Leibler-Divergence is computed from the binned kernel density estimates of the empirical $\hat{f}_e$ and simulated theoretical $\hat{f}_t$ data.

$$
D_{\text{KL}}(\widehat{f}_e ~ \lVert ~ \widehat{f}_t)=\nsum_{u=1}^{n_{\text{grid}}}\nsum_{v=1}^{n_{\text{grid}}}\widehat{f}_e(u, v)\ln\left(\frac{\widehat{f}_e(u,v)}{\widehat{f}_t(u,v)}\right)
$$ {#eq-kld}


### Parameter Optimization with Differential Evolution

Summarizing the previous sections, the simulation framework within the publication bias model of SPEEC requires the distributional parameters for the marginal distributions of effect size and sample size and the publication bias parameter as input and returns a single scalar value representing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the estimated joint kernel density of the simulated theoretical data and the empirical meta-analytical data. This framework can be considered as an optimization problem of finding parameter values for such that 

$$
\begin{gathered}
\min_{\mu_d,  ~ \sigma^2_d,  ~ \mu_n, ~ \phi_n, ~ \omega_{PBS}} \Big\{D_{\text{KL}}(\widehat{f}_e ~ \| ~ \widehat{f}_t) \Big\},  \\ \text{subject to:} ~ \mu_d, ~ \sigma^2_d, ~ \mu_n, ~ \phi_n,~ \omega_{PBS} \in \mathbb{R}, \quad \text{where}  \quad 0 \leq \omega_{PBS} \leq 1, \\
-4 \leq \mu_d \leq 4, \quad 0 \leq \sigma^2_d \leq 6,  \quad 10 \leq \mu_n \leq 15000, \quad 0.01 \leq \phi_n \leq 1000.
\end{gathered}
$$ {#eq-optim}


For this purpose, we use the differential evolution [DE, @storn_differential_1997], which is a simple algorithm for global optimization [@feoktistov_differential_2006]. DE is an evolutionary metaheuristic based on principles such as as mutation, cross over and selection, and requires  only few control parameters that are generally straightforward to select to achieve favorable outcomes in comparison to other optimization algorithms [@storn_differential_1997]. Importantly, all parameters of the DE algorithm including the control parameters, the stopping criterion and boundary constraints of the differential evolution algorithm were defined globally for the parameter estimation of all meta-analyses.

To apply DE for optimization within the SPEEC approach, the R package *RcppDE* [@edelbuettel_rcppde_2022] was utilized, which implements the classical DE algorithm $\mathsf{DE/rand/1}$ [@storn_differential_1997]. The control parameters for DE were chosen based on the recommendations of @storn_differential_1997 with additional adjustments informed by preliminary testing of simulated data from the simulation framework of SPEEC, setting the population size $NP$ to 150, the mutation constant $F$ to 0.9 and the crossover constant $CR$ to 0.1. In the application of the DE algorithm, we adopted a direct termination criteria approach [@jain_termination_2001; @ghoreishi_termination_2017], with the termination condition being the maximum number of generations. Since there are no universally applicable default values for the maximum number of generations, as it is contingent upon the optimization problem at hand [@jain_termination_2001], the choice for $t_{\text{max}}$ was also informed by preliminary testing of the simulation framework of SPEEC. These tests suggested that $t_{\text{max}} = 1000$ is a reasonable decision. In determining the boundaries for the parameter search space (see @eq-optim), a balance was made between avoiding boundaries that are too wide, which could lead to inefficient exploration of the search space, and ensuring that the boundaries are not too narrow to ensure sufficient coverage of the potential parameters. More specifically, the minima and maxima for all distributional parameters were determined using Maximum Likelihood (see Table XXX), and the boundaries were set slightly above those values to ensure good coverage. 

## Secondary Data Description

To examine the confirmatory hypotheses of this study aiming to provide a preliminary assessment of the viability of the SPEEC method, we use secondary data sourced from previous research by @linden_heterogeneity_2021. The dataset can be accessed both from its original source (see https://osf.io/yr3xd/) and through the OSF and GitHub repositories associated with this project (see section [Appendix B: Research Transparency Statement](Appendix B: Research Transparency Statement)). Furthermore, detailed metadata of the dataset and a transparency statement regarding prior knowledge of the data are provided in the preregistration of this study. The dataset is comprehensive and includes both "traditional" meta-analyses and registered replication reports for which publication bias is absent. The dataset encompasses a total of 207 research syntheses covering various psychological phenomena. Within the dataset, there are 150 meta-analyses, each subset consisting of 50 meta-analyses from different subfields of psychology (social psychology, organizational psychology, and cognitive psychology). Additionally, the dataset includes 57 registered replication reports, which are particularly relevant for investigating hypotheses $\hypotheses{iii}{}$ and $\hypotheses{iv}{}$. For each research synthesis, information on the total sample size $n_i$ and effect size $d_i$ of each primary study was compiled. The meta-analyses were selected using random sampling, with predefined inclusion criteria and specified journals from which the data were selected. One important inclusion criterion by @linden_heterogeneity_2021 was that effects must be reported as standardized mean differences (Cohen´s *d* or Hedges´ *g*) or as correlations (Pearson´s *r* or Fisher´s *z*). In cases where a different effect size measure than Cohen’s *d* was used, effect sizes were transformed accordingly [@linden_heterogeneity_2021].

## Statistical Analysis

```{r}
#| echo: false

r_ver <- glue("{version$major}.{version$minor} {version$nickname}")

```

The confiromatory statistical analyses were preregistered and were performed using the R programming language [version `r r_ver`, @r_core_team_r_2023]. Any supplementary analyses not preregistered are explicitly labeled as such. All data and analysis scripts are made available for this thesis (see section [Appendix B: Research Transparency Statement](Appendix B: Research Transparency Statement))

Regarding the hypotheses, in which the publication bias parameter $\pbs$ was the dependent variable ($\hypotheses{i}{}$, $\hypotheses{ii}{}$, $\hypotheses{iv}{}$), beta regression as implemented in the *betareg* package [@zeileis_betareg_2021] was used to analyse the data. This choice was motivated by the restriction of the parameter space for the publication bias to the standard unit interval, whereby non-normality, skewness and heteroscedasticity can anticipated [@cribari-neto_beta_2010; @smithson_better_2006]. Beta regression is recognized for its adaptability in handling such deviations. Because the optimization approach permits $\widehat{\omega}_{\text{PBS}}$ values within the range $0 \leq \widehat{\omega}_{\text{PBS}} \leq 1$ in principle, and the beta-regression model assumes that $0 < \widehat{\omega}_{\text{PBS}} < 1$, a common transformation proposed by @smithson_better_2006 was employed. This transfoormation, denoted as  $\pbs^\prime=\frac{\pbs \cdot(n-1)+0.5}{n}$, subtly adjusts the bounds to sligthly narrow the range between zero and one. We used a logit link for the mean parameter $\mu$ and a identity link for the dispersion paramater that was fixed such that the beta regression model can be described as
 

$$
\begin{gathered}
\omega_{\text{PBS}^\prime_i} \sim  \mathcal{B}(\mu_i, \phi) \\
\log{\bigg(\frac{\mu_i}{1 - \mu_i}\bigg)}=x_i^\top\beta.
\end{gathered}
$$ {#eq-beta-reg}

The independent variables for these three hypotheses were as follows: regarding $\hypotheses{i}{}$, the independent variable was the Fisher *z*-transformed correlation coefficient of the correlation between effect size and sample size, where the transformation is defined as $z_r=\tanh^{-1}(r)$. The independent variable for $\hypotheses{ii}{}$, was the difference $\Delta_{\widehat{\mu}_d}$ between the average effect size estimate of each meta-analysis and the mean parameter of the Gaussian effect size distribution estimated with SPEEC. Lastly, the independent variable for $\hypotheses{iv}{}$, was a binary indicator specifying the research synthesis type (traditional meta-analysis or registered replication report), with registered replication reports set as the reference level for regression. The coefficients from the beta-regressions for these hypotheses were estimated using Maximum Likelihood estimation with the BFGS optimizer.

Hypothesis $\hypothesis{iii}{}$ was aimed at comparing the estimated means of the Gaussian effect size distribution to the average effect sizes. This comparison aimed to assess whether the presence of effects in mean differences $\Delta_{\widehat{\mu}_d}$ deemed large enough to be considered meaningful, according to specified equivalence bounds $\Delta_{EQ}$, can be rejected [@lakens_improving_2020]. For this, we conducted an equivalence test using the Two One-Sided Tests procedure [@schuirmann_comparison_1987] as implemented in the *TOSTER* R package [@lakens_toster_2023]. We employed Welch´s two-sample *t*-tests for dependent samples with corrected degrees of freedom as the Welch's *t*-test generally offers better control of type I error rates when the samples are heteroscedastic, while maintaining robustness compared to Student's *t*-test when test assumptions are satisfied [@delacre_why_2017]. Furthermore, the choice of a dependent samples test was necessitated by the dependence between the pairs of samples originating from the same underlying data. The equivalence bounds $\Delta_{EQ}$ against which the data was tested were defined by the smallest effect size of interest.

## Smallest Effect Size of Interest

For all four hypotheses, the smallest effect size of interest (SESOI) are established based on effect sizes that can be reliably detected, considering the constraints imposed by the sample size resources available for this secondary data analysis [@lakens_performing_2014; @lakens_equivalence_2018]. More specifically, three simulation-based ($\hypotheses{i}{}$, $\hypotheses{ii}{}$, $\hypotheses{iv}{}$) and one analytical ($\hypotheses{iii}{}$)sensitivity power analysis were conducted to determine which effect sizes we have at least 80 percent power ($1-\beta=0.8$) to detect, taking into account the predetermined sample size and fixed type I error rate $\alpha = .05$ (details see [Appendix A: Power Analyses determining the SESOIs](Appendix A: Power Analyses determining the SESOIs)). We specified the SESOI for $\hypotheses{iii}{}$ in raw units and all other SESOIs in odds ratios. The SESOI for the equivalence hypothesis defines the equivalence bounds for the TOST procedure ($\Delta_{EQ} = (-0.17, 0.17)$). Table XXX summarises all four SESOIs of the hypotheses.
